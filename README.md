# LEARNING WEB DEVELOPMENT
  1. Started by setting up my web development environment using WSL (Ubuntu), VSCode and Git.
  2. Began using a few HTML tags and some inline CSS
  3. Nesting paragraphs with some links and Using Global CSS styles, Also learnt about HTML Document structure and metadata.
  4. Pseudo hover, Storing CSS in external files, using the ID selector to apply styles to html elements and using google font (good practice to always have a backup font in your code)
  5. More fundamentals on HTML and CSS. I completed a challenge that tasked me to create a seperate HTML and CSS file. Link the second page to the index html, Applied my own CSS styles to this new page. Also created a shared CSS file that is used by both pages because there some styles that are common to both pages. Organized similar files into single directory for easy access and structure.
